Hamilton Business Leader Election Issue Briefing: Land Transfer Tax
By huzaifa47 on Oct 14th, 2014
We asked the Mayoral Candidates: "New Research has found that, if enacted, the municipal land transfer tax in Hamilton will lead to the loss of $342 million in economic activity and a reduction of $176 million in GDP. If elected as Mayor, will you protect affordable home ownership and commit to not bringing a municipal land transfer tax to Hamilton?"

Under the City of Toronto Act, 2006, the provincial government expanded Toronto’s taxation powers. This gave Toronto the ability to levy a municipal land transfer tax (MLTT) over and above the provincial land transfer tax, adding thousands of dollars to the closing costs of a home purchase.

With financial pressures mounting, municipalities are looking for new revenue tools. During the recent provincial election campaign, the Association of Municipalities of Ontario (AMO) lobbied all three provincial parties for new taxation powers. One of the new taxes being considered is the municipal land transfer tax. AMO continued their push for revenue tools at their 2014 Annual General Conference in August.

Hamilton REALTORS® and the HBL are concerned about the spread of the tax and are calling on their municipal leaders to not allow the spread of the MLTT.

Simply put, Ontario cannot afford a second land transfer tax. A study by Altus Group Economics, conducted on behalf of the Ontario Real Estate Association (OREA), shows that Toronto has experienced a significant loss of economic activity and a corresponding loss of thousands of jobs owing to the MLTT. The report found that the MLTT caused:

• A loss of 38, 278 resale home transactions

• A loss of $2.3 billion in economic activity; and

• A loss of 14, 934 jobs.

OREA also commissioned a study to examine the potential loses that an MLTT could have on local communities like London, Hamilton, Thunder Bay, Ottawa and Mississauga. In Hamilton alone, the report found that the introduction of an MLTT would result in:

• A loss of 5,741 resale home transactions

• A loss of $342 million in economic activity; and

• A loss of 2,240 jobs.

The issue recently came up at the Hamilton Business Leaders Debate on September 30th. When asked whether they would introduce a municipal land transfer tax in Hamilton, each of the three mayoral contenders said “No”.

This is a huge victory for businesses and homeowners in Hamilton. Our municipal leaders should be focusing their attention on ideas that will attract people and investment to our city, not taxes that will hurt the local economy.
