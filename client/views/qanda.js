      { 'answer' : 'I’ve been on the campaign trail for the past 6 months. During that time I’ve reached out to thousands of residents, small business owners and people working in the charitable and non-profit sectors. From Flamborough to Winona and Binbrook to downtown Hamilton people are excited about our campaign to make City Hall more responsive, more accountable and more accessible. To help improve the quality of life for residents in our community, my priorities would be spending tax dollars wisely, creating more high-paying jobs and improving the municipal services we all rely on. The quality and reliability of our municipal services and our property tax rates affect our ability to attract and retain both residents and businesses. As the new Mayor, I will work with Council to ensure that the decisions we make take into account value for tax dollar, prioritizes our needs over our wants and minimizes unnecessary risk. Working together with members of Council and business community we will diversify our economy by getting Hamilton on the radar screen as one of the best locations for business investment on the continent. Under my leadership, we will replicate the success of cities around the world by ensuring that Hamilton is truly ‘open for business’. To reach our potential we need to get the basics right. Fixing our roads and sidewalks, proactively enforcing property standards and improving our transit and transportation infrastructure will help make Hamilton a destination of choice in the Greater Toronto Area.', 'questionStub' : 'Quality of Life', 'question' : '1.

      { 'answer' : 'The real challenge is that the City of Hamilton does not have enough shovel ready land. Other candidates for Mayor are saying that brownfields and the Airport Growth District is the solution. These are empty promises because the reality is that most businesses avoid brownfields due to higher costs, financial risks and the unwillingness of major financial institutions to provide funding. Since we won’t have a lateral route for water and sewers to service additional lands at the airport for at least 10 years, these lands are not part of the short or medium term solution to grow our economy. To thrive in today’s challenging economy, we must super-charge our efforts to promote, attract and create high-paying jobs in our community. Since Hamilton competes with neighbouring municipalities for new business investment, simply hiring more staff or spending more money on economic development will not achieve the results we need. To build a strong city we have to diversify our economy by getting Hamilton on the radar screen as a competitive location for business investment in North America. Cities around the world are achieving great success due to hands-on Mayors and Councillors who are active in recruiting new businesses from outside the community. We need an aggressive foreign investment strategy utilizing a ‘Team Hamilton’ approach to attract business to our Port and secure head offices from around the world. As your new Mayor, I will work with Council and the City’s Economic Development department to bring new businesses to Hamilton from key sectors and regions. I have the proven experience promoting our province and our community on the national and international stage. We can’t achieve the prosperity we deserve with leadership from the past.', 'questionStub' : 'Economy', 'question' : '2.

Positive results include: improved municipal planning as a result of taking into account the needs and issues most relevant to youth; fostering a better understanding of local government and the community and providing exposure to careers in government. As the new Mayor, I will work with Council to provide the leaders of tomorrow with opportunities today. I will also open the door to the Mayor’s office to ensure youth have a voice when it comes to community decision-making. One proven method used in municipalities across North America is a youth cabinet. This group would bring together young people between the ages of 14 and 24 to provide advise on issues facing our community from a youth perspective. I will also work in partnership with the local private and public sector organizations to create a summer internship program for students in grads 11 and 12 or college and university. These 8-week paid internships would place as many students as possible in either the Mayor’s office or in corporate offices and on the shop floors of top companies in Hamilton.

Every year the city relies on planning and legal experts to craft various bylaws to administer everything from permitted uses to parking and signage. Since most of our residents aren’t planning or legal experts often times the city’s bylaws and fine print is difficult to understand. We will make City Hall more user friendly by adopting plain language protocol so that city bylaws are easily understood.

We’re fortunate in Hamilton to have three Chambers of Commerce and 13 Business Improvement Areas that give local businesses a strong voice. Unfortunately local businesses often feel that their success comes not because of – but in spite of the City. This must change. As the new Mayor I will work to develop stronger links between the City, the Chambers of Commerce, BIAs, Tourism Hamilton and other business who may not be affiliated with any organization.

      { 'answer' : 'As a former Transportation Minister for the province of Ontario I have a strong understanding of how senior levels of government make funding decisions on various transportation infrastructure. As the Minister I committed funding for the completion of the Red Hill Valley Parkway; I was also credited with putting the ‘go’ back in GO Transit. With the province continuing to run a budget deficit, it’s unrealistic to expect the Wynne government will fully fund Hamilton’s LRT when they only paid for a third of the cost in Waterloo Region. Earlier this month, Ontario’s new Transportation Minister appeared to ‘leave the door open to scrapping the LRT in favour of something cheaper and less ambitious like expanded bus service. According to a December 2013 study from the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy, bus rapid transit, can spur development more efficiently and at a lower cost than LRT. Even the Ontario Ministry of Transportation’s experts have confirmed that rapid buses will deliver more value for money. Many of our neighbouring regions have pursued bus rapid transit to significantly improve mobility and dramatically increase ridership at a fraction of the cost. I think it’s time we worked with the province on a plan taxpayers can afford that will improve our transit system by expanding the HSR and growing our ridership. Although we’ve made tremendous progress on our tax competitiveness, Hamilton is still one of the highest taxed municipalities in the province. If we didn’t have a yearly infrastructure deficit of $200 million and a debt of $1 billion in two years the LRT conversation might be very different. In my view, saddling homeowners with higher property taxes to pay for the LRT is reckless. We need to wisely co-ordinate improvements to our transportation infrastructure which includes local transit, bus rapid transit, rebuilding our streets as required with street conversions as necessary, bridge repairs and connections with GO Transit. Hamilton’s new Mayor must have a working knowledge of all the key transportation pinch points. Whether it’s over-crowding of the B-line during rush hour, traffic gridlock on the 403, daily traffic jams on the Linc and Redhill Valley Parkway, congestion on Upper James and mountain, and over 300 urban streets without sidewalks, our residents expect the next Council to act on these transportation priorities.

      { 'answer' : 'When sighting ideal locations for new industrial and commercial growth, companies are looking for affordable, shovel ready land. The biggest challenge we face in converting contaminated brownfields around our port and throughout the city is that most businesses do not want to assume the financial risk and liability. Complicating things further is that major lending institutions refuse to finance brownfield remediation sites due to the risk of unforeseen off-site migration and unknown contaminants that often result in unexpected and costly additional remediation efforts. Hamilton has a large current and potential inventory of brownfield sites but the complexity in their rehabilitation means it won’t happen quickly…and it won’t happen without incentives from all levels of government. The Airport Employment Growth District presents the City of Hamilton with many exciting opportunities. Currently, we have 80 acres of shovel ready land in the proximity of the old golf course that is serviced. We also have 60 acres of shovel ready land in the Red Hill Valley Business Park and approximately 40 acres in the Ancaster Business Park. When counting our inventory of available development lands, it’s important to include the shovel ready lands outside the airport district. Since we won’t have a lateral route for water and sewers to service additional lands at the airport for at least 10 years, we need to include all existing shovel ready lands when considering short and medium term opportunities for new business development. As for the types of industry, we need to continue diversifying our economy to help minimize the impact to our community from future economic downturns. As the new Mayor, I will adopt a hands-on approach to economic development. I will work with Council, business and union leaders as well as senior levels of government to attract employers from key sectors including food processing, pharmaceuticals, medical technology, high tech energy components, and agricultural to name a few.

What kind of development would you like to see around these hubs, especially the current and future brownfield vacancies at Hamilton’s Waterfront Industrial areas?'},
      { 'answer' : 'Hamilton’s development charges are calculated on actual municipal capital service growth demands minus any benefit to existing property owners. As Chair of the Developments Charges Review Sub-Committee, I was proud that this year’s collaborative process was approved without appeals. Hamilton is highly competitive with development charges in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton area. Municipalities have a definite effect on the affordability of homeownership through property taxes and water and wastewater rates among other things. The strength of the overall housing market can not be regulated by any municipal government. What we can do is ensure that we manage tax dollars wisely in order to keep development charges and property taxes affordable. The upcoming review of the provincial Green Belt will impact our community. At this point the provincial government has not provided any clear indication on their intentions for this review. I believe at this point it would be premature for the City to comment until we understand the terms of the review.', 'questionStub' : 'Housing Affordability', 'question' : '9.

      { 'answer' : 'Safe and affordable housing impacts the overall health and well-being of individuals and families. With over 5,400 people on the waiting list locally there is an urgent need for the City to act. Section 37 of the Ontario Planning Act allows municipalities to grant increased height and density of a development if an overall community benefit results. The specific community benefit sought must be outlined in the municipality’s official plan. Under Hamilton’s new Urban Official Plan, affordable housing is identified as a community benefit. Burlington has used this section of the Planning Act since 2007 to expand their supply of affordable housing. Doing the same in Hamilton would help take people off the waiting list by creating more affordable housing units at no cost to the taxpayer. Section 37 provides an opportunity to help address an immediate need without costing taxpayers a dime. We don’t need expensive studies or consultant reports to follow Burlington’s lead. As the new Mayor, I will support local organizations like the YWCA, Social Planning Council, Community Legal Clinic, Good Shepherd Centres, the Street Youth Collaborative and any organization committed to addressing the critical shortage of affordable housing in our community.', 'questionStub' : 'Housing Opportunities', 'question' : '10. Given Council’s adoption of the 10-year Housing and Homelessness Action Plan how would you advocate for increased housing opportunities for all Hamiltonians?'},

If elected as Mayor, will you protect affordable home ownership and commit to not bringing a municipal land transfer tax to Hamilton?'},
      { 'answer' : 'Revitalizing downtown Hamilton is one of many vital pillars to our city’s future prosperity, but it’s important to remember we have at least 7 downtown areas and 13 business improvement areas across the city. To bring our community together we need to start treating all areas of our community equally…we need to spread our focus beyond downtown. I was born at St. Joe’s and raised on Hamilton Mountain. I remember when downtown Hamilton was the place to live, work and play. The good news is that we’ve made significant progress downtown but there’s more to do across the city. We need to be more proactive in the enforcement of property standards, and encourage land speculators to start their development projects now. To stimulate growth now we need to create a sense of urgency. The city’s Community Investment Project Area, (CIPA) was designed to be a catalyst for development not a permanent policy. As Hamilton’s new Mayor, I will work with Council to implement a timely phase out of the CIPA program over the next 5 years. As our neighbouring municipalities are running out of developable land and our connection to GO transit improves our community is becoming the destination of choice in the GTA.', 'questionStub' : 'Downtown Revitalization', 'question' : '12.

Community engagement and meaningful dialogue are the best option to stimulate the conversation going and the only way to reach consensus on this important issue.• I have remained supportive of LRT as a viable public transit option for Hamilton because it has the potential to attract millions of outside investment dollars into our community (as evidenced in Kitchener-Waterloo, Ottawa, Toronto and Calgary) resulting in thousands of new employment opportunities, growth and re-urbanization, and huge potential for economic uplift and additional revenue for the entire city.

The Hamilton commercial and residential real estate market is facing pressures such as limited land availability in the urban boundary and increasing land values, and affordability will become a greater challenge over the next few years. Furthermore, the expansion in scope and pricing of development application fees and development charges has put additional pressure on the real estate affordability. Lastly, 2015 will see a review of, among a number of other related plans, the Greenbelt, with an eye to modifying or expanding its limits.  What are your thoughts on ensuring that businesses and home buyers will continue to find affordability and choice in Hamilton?'},
      { 'answer' : '10. The Housing and Homelessness Action Plan is clear about the importance of the role of advocacy .The first thing would be to advocate to our senior levels of government to partner with the City to address our housing issues - by which I mean pay their share so it does not fall on the local taxpayer alone. The Province and the Federal government long ago vacated the affordable housing field and while they have returned to a degree it has not been nearly enough. Affordable housing makes economic sense. The business case for affordable housing needs to be placed before all three levels of government as an issue that requires our immediate attention as a priority in our community. The execution of the Housing and Homelessness Action Plan requires clear leadership from both council and the Mayor’s office.' , 'questionStub' : 'Housing Opportunities', 'question' : '10. Given Council’s adoption of the 10-year Housing and Homelessness Action Plan how would you advocate for increased housing opportunities for all Hamiltonians?'},
      { 'answer' : '11. Toronto is the only municipality in Ontario to enact the municipal land transfer tax (in 2008). Thepower to levy this tax was given to Toronto City Council through the Toronto Municipal Act. Toronto currently receives approximately $300M in revenues each year from this Tax. Given the size of Hamilton compared to Toronto and the fact that real estate values in Toronto are significantly higher than they are in Hamilton, the municipality could expect to gain anywhere between $10 and $15 million annually. Considering the economic losses to the City as outlined above, it is obvious that this tax would be detrimental to the City in the long run. Also given the current legislation as it pertains to Toronto, City Council would have the authority to determine if and how the tax would be levied.  By definition, municipal taxes are set to recover the cost of services provided and consumed by Hamilton residents. It is highly unlikely that the transfer of a property would add significant, additional costs to the City. Therefore, levying a municipal land transfer tax would simply be viewed as a tax grab, which I do not support.' , 'questionStub' : 'Land Transfer Tax', 'question' : '11. New Research has found that, if enacted, the municipal land transfer tax in Hamilton will lead to the loss of $342 million in economic activity and a reduction of $176 million in GDP. If elected as Mayor, will you protect affordable home ownership and commit to not bringing a municipal land transfer tax to Hamilton?'},
      { 'answer' : '12. A key component to the City\'s financial sustainability is its ability to increase its assessment base. Commercial and Industrial taxes have fallen dramatically over the last 40 years. Downtown revitalization can help create additional commercial tax assessment. Currently, Hamilton offers many tax and loan incentives to attract new businesses to the core and to encourage current property owners to develop their lands. This, together with key partnerships the City has formed in the past, has resulted in significant activity downtown. It is my view that Hamilton has begun to turn the corner in revitalizing our downtown. Going forward, we need to capitalize on the current momentum by investigating additional incentives for current property owners to reinvest in their properties. As Mayor, I would maintain and strengthen partnerships with property owners and the BIA in the core in an effort to increase economic activity downtown. I will continue to partner with anyone interested in either locating or expanding their businesses in the core. I would also work with Council and City staff to create a comprehensive set of economic incentives for the downtown core and business improvement areas across Hamilton. These efforts should include both previously tabled incentives and new incentives curently being used in other jurisdictions across the Country.' , 'questionStub' : 'Downtown Revitalization', 'question' : '12. How do you envision the role of a revitalizing downtown core as a key pillar of Hamilton’s economic future and what policy goals will you champion to further facilitate it?'}

      { 'answer' : '1. My platform has identified 5 key themes I believe contribute to the quality of life for Hamiltonians, both separately and together. They are: Stronger Neighbourhoods, Smarter Growth, Healthier Environment, More Open Government, More Jobs. For example, stronger neighbourhoods are one of the results of smarter growth (better not just bigger), which protects our environment (built and natural), and produces more jobs (for long term residents, newcomers, and new graduates). Within those, top three things include: Waterfront Development; Safer Neighbourhood Streets and Sidewalks; and Improving Hamilton’s Image.' , 'questionStub' : 'Quality of Life', 'question' : '1. What three things would you advocate for that would increase the quality of life for Hamiltonians, and attract new residents to the city?'},
      { 'answer' : '2. My focus is to find new revenue from new sources. Smarter growth helps to deliver on that. Currently, we have lower commercial office tax rates. I want to leverage that competitive advantage to attract more mid sized, job-rich sectors to Hamilton. My proposed Open For Business Contract will help get those businesses open faster. Increasing our commercial and retail tax base is key to keeping the lid on residential property taxes. ' , 'questionStub' : 'Economy', 'question' : '2. Hamilton has a tax base imbalance (77% residential vs. 23% commercial/industrial in 2013), coupled with an industrial vacancy rate of less than 2%. How will you overcome these challenges to grow the city’s economy and attract additional corporate investment?' }, 
      { 'answer' : '3. I see the Mayor’s role as one of leader. The Mayor needs to foster great relationships at all levels of government and to use those relationships to communicate a clear, compelling vision for Hamilton. But, as has been pointed out by many, the Mayor has one vote. That means that we attract investment to our City be working together as a leadership team. There is a ton of strength around the Council table. I plan to enlist those strengths to achieve success. I’ve talked about this before as “focused collaboration”. It’s the only way to be successful.' , 'questionStub' : 'Industry Clusters', 'question' : '3. The City of Hamilton’s Economic Development division has identified several industry clusters with high potential (advanced manufacturing; agribusiness & food processing, clean tech; creative industries; and life sciences). What is the mayor’s role in attracting investment in these clusters?' },
      { 'answer' : '4. Again, this speaks to my More Jobs theme. If we don’t focus our efforts as a City on attracting job-rich sectors, our graduates from our 3 post-secondary institutions have to look elsewhere for work. That’s not good for them, neither as individuals or as members of families, nor for the future of our City. I believe McMaster University Downtown campus is a big win, helping to get students out of the “Westdale Bubble” and deeply into the heart of our city. ' , 'questionStub' : 'Education & Youth', 'question' : '4. Hamilton has some of the top post-secondary education institutions in Canada. What role would you play in the attraction, engagement and retention of youth in the city of Hamilton?'},
      { 'answer' : '5. I’ve been pretty clear this is a message I’ve heard loud and clear from businesspeople I’ve met on my 100 Day Neighbourhood Tour, as well as from businesses with whom I worked as Councillor for Ward 1. That’s why I have proposed an Open For Business Contract between the City of Hamilton and investors, whether small business entrepreneurs or large scale developers and investors. We don’t have to break the rules to follow the rules faster. We need a mutually beneficial and clear contract that respects the needs and realities of both parties, with dates, deliverables, expectations, etc. As a City, we need to do a better job of this. Currently, our internal culture and procedures are making life too difficult and too expensive for people who want to invest in our City.' , 'questionStub' : 'Red Tape', 'question' : '5. Our members business ventures rely heavily on the ease with which their project applications are reviewed and processed by City staff; as well as the clarity and quality of information available to current and prospective business owners. Considering “government red tape” is a perennial election topic, what ideas and priorities do you have to foster more effective interaction between businesses and City Hall?'},
      { 'answer' : '6. I believe great relationships with all levels of government include all partners - Council, senior staff, businesspeople, community leaders, and so on. For too many years, we’ve had very spotty and very unclear communication with other levels of government. That has to change immediately. I will ensure I understand what business is looking for and what they’re expectations of government are to realize their goals. I suspect we’ll agree on many things, and perhaps disagree on a few things, but true partners get past those kinds of disagreements through dialogue. Fighting is good for the media, but a very poor way of achieving progress.' , 'questionStub' : 'Business Community', 'question' : '6. As Mayor, what steps will you take to improve and facilitate the voice of the business community with all levels of government?'}, 
      { 'answer' : '7. Efficient goods movement is critical. The new Council Walkability Plan, combined with CarShare, BikeShare, the Shifting Gears Cycling Plan, and the Rapid Ready Plan are designed to shift to a stronger active transportation focus. The more people move to other modes, the more space on the roads for moving goods and creating commerce.  I articulated a 4-part Transit City Plan in May. I’ve also posted a video that explains my plan. As is the case with all municipalities, it relies on partnering with the provincial government. The 4 parts are: 1. Increase Neighbourhood Bus Service. 2. Enhance the Upper James A-Line Express on the mountain. 3. Implement LRT on the King Street B-Line. 4. Provide online, real-time, mobile data for HSR buses.' , 'questionStub' : 'Transportation', 'question' : '7. As mayor what is your strategic vision for the future of Hamilton’s Transportation Infrastructure? This includes but is not limited to: The future of the Light Rail Transit initiative, Complete Streets conversion, Commercial freight infrastructure etc. '},
      { 'answer' : '8. Brownfield redevelopment is a particularly relevant challenge and opportunity for Hamilton. Our industrial past helped build Hamilton, but it has also left us with an abundance of lands that will need to be remediated before they can once again be productive. What we must all remember is that these brownfields are almost always in already serviced parts of the City. Water lines, sewers, electricity, roads, fire hydrants, etc. already exist. Tapping back into them makes sense on so many levels, including smarter growth. The issue is one of remediation. That will take further innovation and cooperation, not only with potential investors, but with all levels of government. The fact is, it makes good business and social sense to figure this out. I think we all have to agree that the changes we’ve made along our waterfront have been good for all Hamiltonians. Great planning, great cooperation, focused on achieving a great vision are all within our grasp.  John C. Munro Airport has great potential in growing our already successful freight business, bolstered by employment lands in the AEGD. Additional passenger opportunities must be explored. Part of this must be investigating potential partnerships with the GTAA.' , 'questionStub' : 'Industrial Development', 'question' : '8. Hamilton has significant potential for industrial and commercial growth close to its transportation hubs, namely the Hamilton International Airport and the Hamilton Port Authority. What kind of development would you like to see around these hubs, especially the current and future brownfield vacancies at Hamilton’s Waterfront Industrial areas?'},
      { 'answer' : '9. While land values have been rising within a Hamilton context, they remain affordable for those seeking real estate from the GTA. Our industrial land supply has never been better with the Red Hill Business Park being serviced now, and the 555 ha Airport Employment Growth Area to come in the near future, along with the West Hamilton Innovation District, and lands along the busiest port in the Great Lakes, Hamilton Harbour. The city has  a good residential land supply which will improve with increasing the focus on efficiently using intensification lands within the existing urban boundary. The Elfrida expansion area has been identified for a future urban boundary expansion.' , 'questionStub' : 'Housing Affordability', 'question' : '9. The Hamilton commercial and residential real estate market is facing pressures such as limited land availability in the urban boundary and increasing land values, and affordability will become a greater challenge over the next few years.

      { 'answer' : '10. As President of City Housing Hamilton over the past decade I‘ve led the creation of hundreds of new affordable housing units across the City, with additional units planned over the next 3 years. Hamilton needs a tripartite agreement with the Federal and Provincial governments in order to successfully implement this necessary plan, achieved through and aggressive government relations strategy. The City needs to invite partnership with the private sector to include affordable housing units in their for-profit developments by taking advantage of Section 37 of the Planning Act, allowing additional density in exchange for public benefit.' , 'questionStub' : 'Housing Opportunities', 'question' : '10. Given Council’s adoption of the 10-year Housing and Homelessness Action Plan how would you advocate for increased housing opportunities for all Hamiltonians?'},
      { 'answer' : '11. I have no intention of introducing a land transfer tax to Hamilton.' , 'questionStub' : 'Land Transfer Tax', 'question' : '11. New Research has found that, if enacted, the municipal land transfer tax in Hamilton will lead to the loss of $342 million in economic activity and a reduction of $176 million in GDP. If elected as Mayor, will you protect affordable home ownership and commit to not bringing a municipal land transfer tax to Hamilton?'},
      { 'answer' : '12. We’ve already seen great progress downtown through Council’s ambitious grants and loans program and a huge boost from private sector investment. Commercial, retail, residential, arts, etc. The Chamber’s own members are behind some of these changes. Just look at the potential for the Royal Connaught. One city block that’s already serviced by water, sewage, electricity, transit, police, fire department, EMS,etc. that will become the home to over 1300 people, and to new businesses. Half of them will be located in two historic buildings. That’s new property taxes from 700 residential units, and likely a few dozen new businesses. All downtown. All on one city block. The implications to businesses beyond that single city block are significant too. The implications to new residential units beyond that single city block are also compelling. I will focus on bringing more office employment to downtown, renovating existing stock and encouraging new builds. I will also support a stronger link to the waterfront. My belief is that a healthier environment includes built and natural environment. I love to see creative adaptive reuse of our built heritage. Entrepreneurs have proven there is a market for such projects, both residential and commercial. I want to encourage more of that, as well as new builds where we have empty lots at the moment. We’re seeing progress that is tangible, profitable, and sustainable. For businesspeople and for residents, that’s a great combination.' , 'questionStub' : 'Downtown Revitalization', 'question' : '12.
